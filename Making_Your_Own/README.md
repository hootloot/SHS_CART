# Making Your Own Kivy Application

### Here create your own Kivy Application:

1. Make a Kivy app that adds all the numbers you input. 
> You input the numbers 5, 2, 1
> It outputs 8

2. Change the layout of the application
> The current layout of the app is "gridlayout". So the layout has a grid like pattern, with collums and sections. 
> By look at this: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/widgets.html#organize-with-layouts
> Try changing the layout to "BoxLayout", read further for information about the "Boxlayout" as well. 

3. Open the folder ```Last Step```, when you've done both of these assignments and shown them to us

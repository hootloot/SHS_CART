# SHS_CART

Required Software:
Kivy: used for creating cross-platform applications with python (just need to import it into python)
Pycharm: The IDE used for python (would be nice to have but is not necessary)
Pip (have pip installed into python as it is used to install Kivy)
Xcode: An application used to develop iOS applications and run them on devices
Database (TBD)
IOS Developer Account (to put it on the AppStore)
TestFlight (used to publish the application to the AppStore)
Might also need access to some terminal commands

General Process of Making the Application:

Install pip on python
Install Kivy using pip
Use a python IDE to create an application using the imported Kivy module
Open the terminal and follow the direction given here: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-ios.html to make a copy of the application as an Xcode project
Use TestFlight to push the application out to others and publish the application to the AppStore (An Apple Developer account, which costs $99, is needed for this step)

*This is a very general design to make any python application and I will work on learning the functions needed for creating this specific application*

### Update for 11/3/21:
Took a look at this sample pong application: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html
Learned that some of this could be tested and run in repl.it
Using kivy has a similar object-oriented structure
You can run and view the UI using this as well
